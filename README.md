## Deliverable 1: Use Resampling Models to Predict Credit Risk
I used the following four methods (i.e. Naive Random Oversampling, SMOTE Oversampling, Undersampling and Combination (Over and Under) Sampling) for Deliverable 1 to predict credit risk.
###### Random Oversampling
The random oversampling model had the following metrics..
* Balanced Accuracy: 0.661
* Precision and Recall: This model predicted high risk datapoints with a precision of 0.01 and a recall of 0.72.

###### SMOTE Oversampling
The SMOTE oversampling model had the following metrics..
* Balanced Accuracy: 0.658
* Precision and Recall: This model predicted high risk datapoints with a precision of 0.01 and a recall of 0.62.

###### ClusterCentroids Undersampling
The ClusterCentroids Undersampling model had the following metrics..
* Balanced Accuracy: 0.658
* Precision and Recall: This model predicted high risk datapoints with a precision of 0.01 and a recall of 0.72.

###### Combination (Over and Under) Sampling
The Combination (Over and Under) Sampling model had the following metrics..
* Balanced Accuracy: 0.661
* Precision and Recall: This model predicted high risk datapoints with a precision of 0.01 and a recall of 0.77.
